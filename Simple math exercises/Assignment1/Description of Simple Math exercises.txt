                 						Situation

You are a computer officer of a primary school. 
You are asked to develop an Android application to teach junior students basic mathematics operation including addition, 
subtraction, multiplication and division interactively.

 Your application should be in the form of an exercise in which 10 questions are generated randomly and each question is of one of the types below:
1)Adding an integer X to another integer Y where X, Y in [1, 99].
2)Subtracting an integer X from another integer Y where X, Y in the [1, 99] and Y >X
3)Multiplying an integer X by another integer Y where X, Y in [1, 20].
4)Dividing an integer X by another integer Y where X, Y in [1, 99] and the quotient of X / Ymust be an integer.                               














						----What do this simple app do-----

	1.Create random math question

	

	2.The application will record down the number of question which is correct or wrong, 
	the correct answer of the question, the number of question given up 

	3.Text to speech function is used. When the user input negative number or non-integer answer,the system will 
	remind him in voice output.Besides, the system will also tell whether the answer is true or false after the user is input an answer.
	If the answer is incorrect, the system will tell out the correct answer.

	
	4.The summary is displayed once 5 minutes is end or 10 questions are passed. The summary will display all the result of user and read them out in voice.
